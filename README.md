# Codex Customer Discovery Skills

Two complementary Codex skills for finding potential first customers and learning from evidence-based CustDev interviews.

It defines the ideal customer profile, researches public sources, links the evidence behind every prospect, ranks fit and timing, drafts a source-based opener, and creates a polished HTML report. It never sends outreach automatically.

## What It Does

- Analyzes a startup URL, repository, or product description
- Defines the primary and adjacent ideal customer profiles
- Finds explicit demand, pain, workaround, switching, and timing signals
- Qualifies prospects with an evidence-based score
- Links every primary prospect to the original public source
- Drafts respectful, source-based outreach openers
- Creates a responsive standalone HTML report
- Keeps all outreach manual by default
- Avoids private contact enrichment and sensitive personal data

## Installation

```bash
npx --yes codex-first-customer-finder-skill@latest
```

This installs the skill into:

```text
~/.codex/skills/first-customer-finder
```

Restart Codex after installation.

The package installs both `$first-customer-finder` and `$custdev-interviewer`.

## Usage

Find the first ten potential customers:

```text
Use $first-customer-finder to find ten evidence-backed potential first customers for https://example.com and create the final HTML report.
```

Find design partners:

```text
Use $first-customer-finder in design-partners mode for this startup: [URL]. Prioritize people publicly describing the problem and likely to give product feedback.
```

B2B research:

```text
Use $first-customer-finder in b2b mode for [URL]. Find public business triggers, qualify the relevant companies, and draft one opener per prospect without sending anything.
```

Conduct a CustDev interview interactively:

```text
Use $custdev-interviewer to interview me about the last time our company actively searched for new customers. Ask one question at a time.
```

Analyze interview transcripts:

```text
Use $custdev-interviewer to analyze these transcripts, separate facts from hypotheses, and synthesize situation-based segments: [transcripts].
```

## Output

The report includes:

1. Early-customer verdict
2. Primary ICP and disqualifiers
3. Highest-confidence prospect
4. Evidence-backed prospect shortlist
5. Fit and timing scores
6. Source links and signal dates
7. Personalized outreach openers
8. Repeated pain patterns
9. Seven-day manual outreach plan
10. Research limitations

Prospects are hypotheses based on public signals, not confirmed customers or guaranteed buyers.

## Modes

- `quick`: up to five strong prospects
- `standard`: up to ten prospects across several source types
- `deep`: up to twenty prospects and repeated-pattern analysis
- `design-partners`: feedback-oriented early adopters
- `b2b`: companies and public business triggers
- `community`: explicit requests and public discussion signals
